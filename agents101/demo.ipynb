Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world's worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025.

At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence.
