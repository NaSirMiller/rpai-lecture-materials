# RPai Lecture Materials

## Overview

This repository contains materials such as code, and notes created and taken by Na'Sir Miller, in preparation RPai lectures. If you are interested in learning more about AI agents, be sure to checkout the `agents101` directory. For those interested in the Model Context Protocol or MCP, checkout the `mcp` directory. The `hackrpi` directory simply contains a more recent refinement of the `mcp` and `agents101` materials and aims to combine the two into an hour session.
